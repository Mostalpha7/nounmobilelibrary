      "title": "Problem-Solving & Algorithmic Thinking",
      "description": "This course introduces students to the fundamentals of problem-solving within computing contexts. Students will study how to analyse problems, model them, and design systematic procedures (algorithms) to arrive at solutions. Topics include: the nature of problems and strategies for solving them (e.g., trial and error, heuristics, means-ends analysis), computational approaches (brute-force, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, randomized methods), and algorithm representation techniques (flowcharts, pseudocode). The aim is to equip students with the logic, structure and methodology necessary to approach and solve routine and non-routine problems in software and computing environments.",
